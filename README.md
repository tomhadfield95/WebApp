# OPIG Small Molecule Web Apps

*Note: This web spp is still in beta mode. The finished version will be accessible through the [OPIG website](http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/)*

This repository contains a Flask app for [DeLinker](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b01120) (Imrie et al. 2020). 

The app combines the [DeLinker implementation](https://github.com/oxpig/DeLinker) with [3DMol.js](https://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/), so that the users can load two fragments into a molecule viewer, select the atomic exit vectors, and generate a downloadable set of linkers using DeLinker (see example below).

We will shortly be releasing a similar application for [DEVELOP](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/sc/d1sc02436a), a CNN-based tool for fragment growing and elaboration.
